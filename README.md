"""
To create the LoadFile function, I revisited the zyBooks chapter about files to 
remember how to read individual lines from a file. I created a text file "text.txt"
to test my function. To create the UpdateString function, I used my Python exam
cheat sheet to make the inputed string a list, modify the list, and then join the
list back into a string. For the FindWordCount function, I used a counting method
with a for loop. For the ScoreFinder function, I used different string methods like
.lower() and .capitalize(). For the Union function, I revisted the list zyBooks chapter
to find both the reversed() method and the delete function. For the Intersection function,
I used the "in" method from the same chapter. Finally to create the NotIn function,
I used the "not in" method, also from the list zyBooks chapter.
